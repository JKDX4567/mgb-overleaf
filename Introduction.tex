\hspace {2em}Our group is a three-people group and three of us are software engineering majors. Bowen, Gleb and Matthew are all in their 4th year. We are all homebodies who play lots of games, with Matthew’s favorite being Pokemon Unite, Gleb’s being Minecraft and Bowen’s being Yugioh . Matthews goal is to hopefully work in the medical field while still in software, Bowen’s goal is to hopefully find a job after graduate working on software field with decent salaries, while Gleb’s goal is to be able to create his own startup soon after graduation that could eventually lead to financial stability.
